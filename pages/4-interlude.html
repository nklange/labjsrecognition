    <p><strong>Well done for studying those words!</strong></p><br>
    <p>In the next step you will again be shown words in the center of the screen.<br>Some of the words will, in fact,
        be words from the previous part of the experiment, and some words will not have been presented before.</p>
    <p> For each word, you will have to decide whether that word is old or new.<br>
    A word is ‘New' if it has not been presented before.<br>
        A word is ‘Old' if it was presented in the previous stage.</p>
    <p> You will be asked to express how confident you are that a word is old or new, using a six-point scale. Please give your response by
    using the number keys in the main part of the keyboard.</p>
